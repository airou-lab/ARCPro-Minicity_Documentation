For the Bill of Materials, please go to our [ARCPro BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xc6m2KjmdyQvV1nY1KGfAFUgrYJwhJbU0oIUqCPX6PE/edit?usp=sharing).

We recommend following step 1 (below) while you wait for the ordered materials to arrive to save time. 

# How to build

## 1: Download .STEP or .stl files
If you want to modify the car, you will need to download the CAD files. Note, we strongly recommend to use Solidworks, but it requires a subscription. However, since we provided .STEP files as well, you can modify on ANSYS as its free, but be warned, its far more difficult to work with. If you want to use our design without modification, please download the .stl files. This should include:
```
2 Chassis Extension (left and right)
4 Chassis Supports
8 Platform Supports
3 Platforms (they're labelled)
Combined, it takes around 20 hours and 500g of filament per car to 3D print (at 25% infill on Prusa printer)
```
After printing, ensure the parts were printed well, and you have all the parts mentioned above.

## 2: Remove all prexisting parts from the chassis
This includes the existing ESC, protective casing over the driveshaft, and 

## 3: Measure the length of your chassis.
