# ARCPro-Minicity_Documentation
This encompasses all of the materials used to build both ARCPro and the Minicity, and of course, instructions on how to build them. In order to maintain organization, we divided the Minicity and ARCPro into their own respective folders, with their respective instructions inside. Please refer to them to begin. If there is anything missing or questions, please feel free to reach out to dvargas88@ou.edu
